// outside of my functions I will define,
//  sotred orders and incoming orders
let storedOrders = existingBook.length
let incomingOrders = incomingOrder.length
// i will create a calculation function,
//  for parcially fullfilled orders
const partOrder
= (array) => {
// i will create a for loop,
// this will loop the orderbook
  for (let o = 0; o < array.length; i++) {

  }

//i will want to use push to add orders to the end of the array
//i will no longer need to make an object.





//out side of this object I will create my reconsile function
//inside of this function I will deconstruct my orderbook to do all the right calculations
//i will want to let orderBook equal updatedBook
